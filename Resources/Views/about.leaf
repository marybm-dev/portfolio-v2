    <h4>Hi! 👋🏽 I'm Mary and I build mobile and web apps. 🤓📱🖥</h4>
    <p>My favorite programming language is Swift and I particularly enjoy working with the iOS SDK. As of late I've been hacking away with Vapor, a Swift Server framework that's helped me relaunch my site!
    </p>
    <p>I've also worked with Android, Java, C/C++, Ruby on Rails, Python, HTML/HAML, CSS, SASS, Java Server Pages, and JavaScript (mostly vanilla, jQuery, and just a dash of Node).
    </p>
    <p>I'm a quick learner and am happy to leave my comfort zone in the spirit of some good R&amp;D. I love learning and I'm always looking to pick up new frameworks and API's — <b>I thrive on the challenge of getting something to work that I've never done before</b>.
    </p>
    <p>When I'm away from the computer you can find me trail running the Oakland Hills or Alameda shoreline, dancing the night away at an EDM event, or having a picnic with my partner and our boston terrier.
    </p>
    <p><b>If you want to work together feel free to email me!</b> I'm always open to collaborating or even pair programming, just let me know. ✌🏽</p>
